1. you must import hooks from react 
2. Hooks can only be called inside react function components.
3. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component 
4. Hooks can not be conditional 

const [count , setCount] = useState(0)
here count is a state variable and setCount is updated function and the useState(0) is initial value


useEffect(()=>{},[])

useEffect need a call backfunction and , the array is [dependency]

1. Array dependency is optional 
2. if we pass an empty array then it will run once when the component mounts (componentDidMount in class based component)
3. if we do not give any array then it will run every render 
4. if we give any props of values it runs on the first render and any time any dependency value change 


for example : 
1.useEffect(()=>{})                  --> Runs every render
2.useEffect(()=>{},[])               --> Runs only on first time
3.useEffect(()=>{},[props, state])   --> Runs first render nd any time any dependency value change 


  ------------------------------>Context Api<------------------------------

  Context Api we use USECONTEXT hook 
  useContext we have a Provider and Consumer in buit so Provider provied data and Consumer get the data
